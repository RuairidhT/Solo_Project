## BRIEF
To create an OOP-based application with utilisation of supporting tools, methodologies and technologies that encapsulate all core modules covered during training. The individual project can be on any subject you deem fit of encapsulating all aspects of the aforementioned modules. This could be a business case, such as a library or supermarket system, or something to do with a hobby of yours â€“ as long as the application is CRUD functional.

### Solution

I decided to create a gym application that would allow the user to view, add, update and delete the different machines and exercises that could be done at the gym. A many to many relationship between the machines and exercises has been added to allow the user to see what machines can be used for an exercise and vice versa.
